# TCL & Linux Scripting for Semiconductor Design

## Overview  
This repository contains course materials, lab scripts, and hands-on exercises from the **VSD TCL & Linux Workshop**. The goal is to build strong proficiency in **TCL scripting** and **Linux-based automation** for semiconductor digital design flows.

The content focuses on automating design constraints, integrating with open-source tools like **Yosys** and **OpenTimer**, and performing **Quality of Results (QOR)** analysis using TCL procedures.

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Master the fundamentals and advanced concepts of **TCL scripting**
- Automate generation of constraint files (CSV/SDC to OpenTimer)
- Integrate TCL with **Yosys** for RTL synthesis and memory module generation
- Perform hierarchical design checks and error detection
- Analyze QOR metrics including:
  - **WNS** (Worst Negative Slack)  
  - **FEP** (False Endpoint Path)
